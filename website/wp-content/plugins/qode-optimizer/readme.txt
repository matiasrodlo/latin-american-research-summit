<h3>Optimize the Images on Your Website, Drive More Conversions and Increase Your Speed Score</h3>

The QODE Optimizer plugin is developed to let you <strong>convert, compress and adjust file sizes for all the images</strong> on your website in a completely streamlined and quick manner.
The plugin allows you to easily perform <strong>bulk or individual image optimization</strong>.
You can convert JPG, PNG and GIF files, adjust default image width & height, as well as choose a <strong>compression method</strong> to be applied to images during the optimization.
For <strong>Lossy</strong> compression methods, you can fine-tune the amount of compression applied, which in turn results in different image qualities.

<h3>The Easy Way to Remove Image Metadata</h3>

The QODE Optimizer provides you with a number of additional options related to images on your site.
You can easily <strong>remove metadata</strong> for all the images on your website, thus reducing their respective file sizes even further.

<h3>Refine the Images Even Further by Converting them to the WebP Format</h3>

If you wish to convert your images to the supremely practical WebP format, the <a href="https://qodeinteractive.com/products/plugins/qode-optimizer-premium/" target="_blank">QODE Optimizer</a> plugin has you covered.
You also have the option to <strong>control the WebP image compression quality</strong>, insert rewriting rules for delivering WebP images on Apache/LiteSpeed servers, and more.

<h3>Follow and Analyze the Process of Optimization in the System Log</h3>

By enabling the system log, you’ll be able to see all the steps that the system takes during the process of image optimization.
This helps you <strong>further refine the optimization</strong> as you’ll be able to see precisely how the optimization affected each individual image in the process.

<h3>Get Even More With Premium!</h3>

The premium version of <a href="https://qodeinteractive.com/products/plugins/qode-optimizer-premium/" target="_blank">QODE Optimizer</a> lets you improve things even further.
You have the option to <strong>enable automatic optimization</strong> for all images uploaded on your website. On top of that, you can also choose specific predetermined image sizes you do not wish to apply the optimization to.
Another useful feature that you get with the premium version lets you <strong>place watermarks</strong> over the regular images on your site and choose where you wish to position them.
One more practical functionality allows you to set a <strong>background fill color</strong> for JPGs – this is particularly useful when converting images with transparent backgrounds to the JPG format.
In addition to this, you can also have the <strong>original images deleted</strong> automatically after conversion, saving up even more in terms of memory.
